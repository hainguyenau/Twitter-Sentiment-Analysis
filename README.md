# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
## Introduction
Twitter so far has been one of the most used social media in the world. From celebrities to politicians, to normal citizens like you and I are using it to convey what we think to others. The most important advantage that Twitter has over other tools is that users are only allowed to post short conversations (or tweets). That is why there are so much values in these posts that we can draw from. Data miners often look at public tweets and analyze their sentiments to have a good insight of the public opinions toward a person, a company, a product an event, and many more. This has proven to be an effective way to help steer businesses to directions that satisfy the most customers.

In this project, I will build a web application that leverages Natural Language Processing to classify whether a tweet has a positive or negative sentiment. The app can also allows users to search for any topic of interest.

## The Data
Since tweets are short sentences, the training dataset I used include 5,300 positive and 5,300 negative short reviews.
